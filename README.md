# Prediction of Protein Secondary Structures

These files store the best-performing model and its weights for the secondary structure prediction:
model_extra_layers_w17

These files will be imported via the json and pickle libraries to construct the neural network for the protein secondary structure predictor.

Additionally, a fasta file for a exemplary protein sequence is stored to allow for testing the parsing of fasta files for the protein structure predictor project.
